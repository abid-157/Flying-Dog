# Game about a flying dog dealing with enemies

![](Gameplay_gif.gif)

Project was forked from [here](https://github.com/MariuszDot/Game_Flying_Dog) written in C/C++ which is Made entirely from scratch using SDL2 libraries.
Uses C++17.

## You want to compile it (for linux)?
Before compilation, you need to install SDL2 library packages. For Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```
Just fork the repository and compile it by typing the command:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -g *.cpp -o main -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer
```

## You want to contribute/use it?
Feel free to do whatever you want with that code. Anyone can contribute to the main project with any new graphics, new mechanics, any contribution.
